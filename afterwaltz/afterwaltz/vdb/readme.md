Here you should put your virtual dub "installation" (currently on the 64-bit version). Files are not included here for obvious reasons, but feel free to email me (subs.in.tokyo@gmail.com).

I recommend combining virtual dub with [FFInputDriver](http://codecpack.co/download/FFInputDriver.html) for support for a broader type of files & mkv support. (There may be better solutions for this issue, that's why I'm opensourcing the god damn script)

**Warning:** Since this is obbiously a beta version, it might break and/or not work on your local computer.
